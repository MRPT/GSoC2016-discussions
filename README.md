# GSoC2016-discussions

Each accepted project has its own "issue" ticket. Most of the daily discussion should happen there, better than in private emails, so all interested mentors (and everybody else) can subscribe and participate. 

## Projects

* [PnP Algorithms toolkit for MRPT](https://github.com/MRPT/GSoC2016-discussions/issues/1)
* [Design and developement of a full graph-based SLAM strategy in mrpt](https://github.com/MRPT/GSoC2016-discussions/issues/2)
* [ROS packages for versatile RBPF-based SLAM](https://github.com/MRPT/GSoC2016-discussions/issues/3)

## Timeline

* April 22 2016: Selected projects announced
* April 22 to May 22: Community bonding period. Get in touch with mentors, read about the MRPT libs and apps, papers, etc. Students may want introduce themselves (if not done already) in the mailing list, discuss on your experience in related projects, etc.
* May 23 to Jun 27: Students work on their projects
  * The usual approach is to work on a fork (unless the mentors agree on something else).
  * Mentors shall regularly inspect the student progress on Github, make comments on his/her work, answer his/her questions in the issue ticket, etc.
  * Students can propose changes in other, related parts of MRPT different from the focus of their project, although they should not get the focus lost from the ultimate goal: successfully finishing their proposed project! ;-) 
* **Jun 20-27:** Midterm evaluation. **Students will pass if they generate a pull request that...**
    * Builds, ideally in travis-ci
    * Has, at least, stubbed out new functionality
    * Code has appropriate Doxygen documentation
    * Has a stubbed out example/tutorial/ROS launch file that builds/runs without errors
    * It observes the recommendations in "[How to contribute](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/wiki/HowToContribute)", which include [C++ style suggestions](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/blob/master/doc/MRPT_Coding_Style.md).
  * **End of summer** (23-29 August 2016): **Students will pass the final evaluation if...** 
    * A complete pull request that builds, full Doxygen documentation, unit test if applicable, complete functionality.
    * A video (e.g. on YouTube) demonstrating your code.

Happy coding! :-)
